# Lab Report 4

Commands run beforehand:
* `ssh cs15lwi23awb@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
* `logout`
* `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java`
* `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests.java`
## 4. Log into ieng6

* Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><enter>`
* Using the up key, you can go to your previously entered commands so pressing this three times goes to the previously entered command, `ssh cs15lwi23awb@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (`logout` does not count as a command)
